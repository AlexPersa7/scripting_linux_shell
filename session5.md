# Session 5: Advanced scripts

So far we have been using one-liners or short scripts that can be easily typed in the terminal.
However, some tasks are more complex than that an require longer scripts, which are typically stored in text files. We will learn how to run and modify script files in this section, with examples in BASH, perl, R and python.

## Shebang

The Shebang interpreter directive is usually the first line on scripts. 
It is used to tell the operating system which interpreter to use to parse the rest of the file.
It takes the following form: ```#!interpreter [arguments]```

These are portable shebangs for some scripting languages:
```
#!/usr/bin/env bash

#!/usr/bin/env perl 

#!/usr/bin/env python # most likely python3 in 2020

#!/usr/bin/env Rscript
```
