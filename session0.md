# Session 0: setup
Computer scientists often start counting from zero.

For this course we are using a virtual machine to run Ubuntu 20.04.
A virtual machine allows us to run a OS different from the one installed on our computer.

One way to do this: TODO (explain this completely)
- Download and install Oracle VM VirtualBox (https://www.virtualbox.org/) on your system
- In your web browser, go to osboxes.org, downloads, and look for Ubuntu 20.04
- Once the image for Ubuntu has been downloaded, open VirtualBox and:
- Click on "New", choose Linux, Ubuntu, and use an existing drive
- Choose the Ubuntu image
- ...

Once the process ends, within VirtualBox choose the Ubuntu virtual machine and click "Start"
