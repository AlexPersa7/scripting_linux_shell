# Session 3: Parsing files and regular expressions

While parsing has different meanings in Computer Science, in data science is broadly the task of extracting features of interest from data files.

## 3.1 Some general formats 

text, CSV, TSV, Excel

Newlines, windows, linux, \n \r

## 3.2 Reading files

while read p; do
  echo "$p"
  done <file.txt

## 3.3 Writing to files


## 3.4 Regular expressions

Regular expressions, or regexes, are useful for extracting information from text files.
Regexes are search patterns expressed in the form of a sequence of text characters
that are used to match particular contents in files.
Their syntax is weird at first, but once youâ€™ve learned it, you can actually use them in most programming languages, such as Python, R, Perl, or sed and awk, with minor differences.

such as code, log files, spreadsheets, or even documents. And while there is a lot of theory behind formal languages, the following lessons and examples will explore the more practical uses of regular expressions so that you can use them as quickly as possible.



Portable Perl regex styles, should work in R and python
